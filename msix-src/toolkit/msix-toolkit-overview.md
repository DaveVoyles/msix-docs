# MSIX Toolkit

The [MSIX Toolkit](https://aka.ms/msixtoolkit) is a collection of tools and scripts that enable IT Pros and developers to build and manage MSIX packages. The toolkit is an open source project on GitHub to allow customers and enthusiasts to contribute directly and provide suggestions and feedback on the content that is available.

## Principles

The MSIX Toolkit follows these principles:

* It is a community-led space where customers can freely contribute source code along with binaries and executables.
* Users can't post artifacts that don't have a corresponding source code unless they are redistributables.
* Until there is sufficient community involvement, a Microsoft employee will oversee the pull requests.
* All contributed source code must include a readme file with detailed instructions on the setup and how to build the source code.

## How to contribute

The [MSIX Toolkit](https://aka.ms/msixtoolkit) repository accepts external contributions via a [pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Create only a single pull request per issue, while keeping the pull requests as small and contained to to a single scenario as possible. Before we can accept a pull request from you, you must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

See the [readme](https://github.com/microsoft/MSIX-Toolkit/blob/master/README.md) for more details on how to contribute.
