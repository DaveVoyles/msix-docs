# Package a desktop app using third-party installers

Below is a list of popular third-party products and installers that support the ability to package a desktop application. You can use them to generate MSI installers or app packages with only a few clicks. While we don't produce documentation on how to use these tools, visit their websites to learn more.

## Advanced Installer

Caphyon provides a free, GUI-based, desktop app packaging tool that helps you to generate a Windows app package for your application with only a few clicks. It can use any installer; even ones that run in silent mode, and performs a validation check to determine whether the application is suitable for packaging. This means that you can use your own virtual machines, without having to download a matching [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) image that can be over 3GB in size.

![Advanced Installer logo](images/Advanced_Installer_Vertical_20.png)

You can use [Advanced Installer](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/) to generate MSI and [Windows app packages](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/uwp-app-package.html) from existing projects. Once imported, you can maintain them by using visual tools that are specifically designed for UWP apps.

Advanced Installer also provides an extension for Visual Studio 2017 and 2015 that can use to [build and debug Desktop Bridge apps](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/debug-desktop-bridge-apps.html).

## Capture
Capture from Access IT Automation is an API driven modular application management offering that enables effortless and autonomous creation of application packages in MSI, AppV, MSIX and app attach formats. 

We provide you with tangible outputs that you can either directly make use of via Configuration Manager and Intune delivery OR you can further utilise our extensive Testing and publishing APIs so that we can create the SCCM and Intune application objects for you to manage User Acceptance Testing to ensure Evergreen IT Application Management. 

![Capture logo](images/Capture-AccessIT.png)

Our MSIX and app attach API offerings are broken down into the following:  
* Package creation for MSI, AppV, MSIX and app attach 
  * AppScan API – We can load all your existing MSI applications and check for MSIX suitability.  Checking for blockers like Boot time services or MSIs with no shortcuts. 
  * MSIX Builder API is for ANY CI/CD pipeline where you need to create an MSIX without the need to snapshot – common examples are DevOps (loose files, binaries). 
  * MSIX Creation API – you supply simple inputs of source package and signature file and we create and digitally sign the MSIX output using snapshot technology. 
  * App attach API – we can cerate as part of the above API per MSIX creation and in addition with this API we can manage grouping up sets of MSIX to create app attach VHD or CIMfs. 
* Testing management 
  * User Acceptance Testing API – we take the MSIX or app attach completed packages and created the Intune objects or Azure WVD objects for publishing and delivery. 
    * We capture the UAT testers pass and fail detail. 
    * We capture the screenshots and full audit of the UAT test. 
    *	We capture the performance of the application on the Windows 10 build. 
  *	Launch and Load Testing API – we autonomously load ALL your applications 1 by 1 onto a Windows 10 build (to compare against other launch and load tests on other Windows 10 build versions) – ensuring your package works on newer Windows 10 
    * We distribute the application using Intune to mimic a real app delivery. 
    * We launch all shortcuts from the MSIX package to ensure no issues. 
    *	We video record this autonomous test for pass or fail of the launch test. 
      *	Passes mean your investment in packaging to MSIX. 
      * Failures provide you with detail so you can remediate the package before moving your end users on to the next version of Windows 10. 
  *	Performance Testing API – Provides you with confidence that high risk package changes perform as expected on your physical desktop and VDI/WVD plant 
    * You can configure the performance counters you wish to monitor. 
    *	You can set the duration in hours of the MSIX Intune delivered package. 
    *	We provide all the results of the application package, specifically looking for any CPU or memory spikes.

## FireGiant

The [FireGiant MSIX extension](https://www.firegiant.com/products/wix-expansion-pack/msix) lets you create Windows app packages and MSI packages simultaneously from the same WiX source code. Every time you build, you can target Windows 10 with a Windows app package and earlier versions of Windows with MSI.

![FireGiant logo](images/FG3rdPartyLogo_50.png)

The FireGiant MSIX extension uses static analysis and intelligent emulation of your WiX projects to create Windows app packages without the disk space and runtime overhead of containers or virtual machines.

Because the FireGiant MSIX extension doesn't convert your installer by running it, you can maintain your WiX installer without having to repeatedly convert it to Windows app packages. All your users on different versions of Windows get your latest improvements and you don't have to worry about MSI and Windows app packages getting out of sync.

Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFBpdBiAYQE) and see how in a couple lines of code FireGiant CEO Rob Mensching creates an Appx (Windows app package) version of the popular open-source 7-Zip compression tool and then how he improves both Windows application and MSI packages with changes in the same WiX source code.
